## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Show task usage details via help task

`gradle help --task init` which will give you the following output

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 2.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](http://forums.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Dependency resolution result produces a graph of components instead of a graph of module versions.

* The dependency resolution result is changed so that it produces a graph of components.
* Various interfaces were renamed to reflect this change:
    * `ResolvedModuleVersionResult` to `ResolvedComponentResult`
    * `ModuleVersionSelectionReason` to `ComponentSelectionReason`
* Renamed methods on `ResolutionResult`:
    * `getAllModuleVersions()` to `getAllComponents()`.
    * `allModuleVersions(Action)` to `allComponents(Action)`.
    * `allModuleVersions(Closure)` to `allComponents(Closure)`.
* Various interface method signatures were changed to return the new component types: `DependencyResult`, `ResolvedComponentResult`, `UnresolvedDependencyResult` and `ResolutionResult`.

### Dependency resolution prefers the latest version regardless of whether it has meta-data or not

TBD
