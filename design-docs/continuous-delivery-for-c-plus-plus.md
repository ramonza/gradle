This document describes a number of improvements to allow C++ projects to be built, tested, published are shared between teams.

# Current state

Currently, the Gradle C++ plugins can compile and link multiple executables and shared libraries. Dependency management is partially implemented, so
that the binaries can be published and resolved in some basic form. There are various missing pieces. For example, dependency meta-data is not
published, and resolved binaries have the incorrect names on some platforms.

## Some terminology

Given a C++ library or executable, we have:

### Producer project

The project that compiles, links and publishes the binary to be shared. This sharing may happen within the same build or across several different builds
via a repository.

### Consumer project

A project that uses the published binary in some form. In the case of a published library, the consumer usually installs, links against the library,
and runs the result. In the case of a published executable, the consumer generally installs and runs the executable.

### Native binary

A binary that runs on a particular native C runtime. This refers to the physical binary file.

### Executable binary

An executable native binary.

### Shared library binary

A library binary that is linked into an executable or shared library at runtime

### Static library binary

A library binary that is linked into an executable or shared library at link time.

### Native component

A software component that runs on the native C runtime. This refers to the logical entity, rather than the physical.

### Native application

A native component that represents an application.

### Native library

A native component that represents a library to be used in other native components.

# Milestone 1

## Story: Allow customization of binaries before and after linking

This story introduces a lifecycle task for each binary, to allow tasks to be wired into the task graph for a given binary. These tasks will be able to modify the object files or binary files before they are consumed.

- Change `Binary` to extend `Buildable`.
- Change `NativeComponent` so that it no longer extends `Buildable`.
- Change the binaries plugin to add a lifecycle task called `${binary.name}`.
- Change the cpp plugin to rename the link tasks for a binary to `link${binary.name}`.
- Change `DefaultClassDirectoryBinary` to implement `getBuildDependencies()` (it currently has an empty implementation).
- Change `CppPlugin` so that the link task for a binary uses the compile task's output as input, rather than depend on the compile task.
- Add an `InstallExecutable` task type and use this to install an executable.
- Change `CppPlugin` so that the install task for an executable uses the executable binary as input, rather than depend on the link task.
- Add `NativeBinary.tasks` property of type `NativeBinaryTasks` that is a `DomainObjectSet<Task>` containing key tasks for a binary.
     - `NativeBinaryTasks.link` and `NativeBinaryTasks.createStaticLib` are convenience methods for accessing the link/create tasks for a binary.

*Note*: There is a breaking change here, as the link task for a given binary has been renamed.

### User visible changes

    apply plugin: 'cpp'

    binaries.all { binary ->
        def stripTask = task("${binary.name}Strip") {
            dependsOn binary.tasks.link
            doFirst {
                ["strip", binary.tasks.link.outputFile].execute()
            }
        }
        binary.builtBy stripTask
    }

## Story: Allow customization of binary compilation and linking

This story allows some configuration of the settings used to compile and link a given binary.

Some initial support for settings that will be shared by all binaries of a component will also be added.

Later stories will add more flexible and convenient support for customization of the settings for a binary.

- Add the following mutable properties to `NativeBinary`:
    - `outputFile`
    - `objectFileDirectory`
    - `compilerArgs`
- Add the following mutable properties to `ExecutableBinary` and `SharedLibraryBinary`:
    - `linkerArgs`
- Add a `binaries` property to `NativeComponent`. This is a `DomainObjectCollection` of all binaries for the component.
- Remove `NativeComponent.compilerArgs` and `linkerArgs` properties. Instead, configuration injection via the `binaries` container can be used to
  define shared settings for the binaries of a component.

### User visible changes

    apply plugin: 'cpp-lib'
    
    libraries {
        main {
            // Defaults for all binaries for this library
            binaries.all {
                compilerArgs = ['-DSOME_DEFINE']
                linkerArgs = ['-lsomelib']
            }
            // Defaults for all shared library binaries for this library
            binaries.withType(SharedLibraryBinary) {
                compilerArgs << '/DDLL_EXPORT'
            }
        }
    }
    
    binaries {
        mainSharedLibrary {
            // Adjust the args for this binary
            compileArgs << '-DSOME_OTHER_DEFINE'
            linkerArgs << '-lotherlib
        }
    }
    
    binaries.withType(NativeBinary) {
        outputFile = file("$buildDir/${name}/${outputFileName}")
        objectFileDirectory = file("$buildDir/${name}/obj")
    }

## Story: Ensure CI builds exercise test coverage for supported tool chains

The CI builds include coverage for each supported tool chain. However, the coverage silently ignores tool chains which are not
available on the current machine. Instead, the CI builds should asert that every expected tool chain is avilable on the current
machine.

Later stories will add further integration test coverage for particular OS and tool chain combinations.

- Change `AbstractBinariesIntegrationSpec` to assert that each expected tool chain is installed on the current machine when
  runnning as part of a CI coverage build.
- Change `AbstractBinariesIntegrationSpec` to use a single tool chain for each machine as part of a CI commit build. For Windows,
  the test should use a recent version of Visual C++, and for Linux, the test should use GCC.
- Install Visual C++ 2010 express, Cygwin and MinGW on the Windows CI agents, as required.
- Install GCC 3 and GCC 4 the linux CI agents, as required.
- Update the server wiki pages to describe the installation steps required for each machine.

## Story: Compile C source files using the C compiler

This story adds support for C source files as inputs to native binaries.

- Add a `CSourceSet` interface.
- Add a `CCompile` task type.
- Change the `cpp` plugin to add a `CCompile` instance for each `CSourceSet` added to a native binary.
- Change the visual C++ toolchain to:
    - Not use `/EHsc` when compiling any source.
    - Use `/TC` to force source language to C for all files in a C source set.
    - Use `/TP` to force source language to C++ for all files in a C++ source set.
- Change the GCC toolchain to:
    - Use `gcc` to compile all source files in a C source set. Should also use `-x c` to force source language to C.
    - Use `g++` to compile all source files in a C++ source set. Should also use `-x c++` to force source language to C++.
- Rework the plugins so that there is something like:
    - A `cpp-lang` plugin, which adds support for C++ source sets and compiling them to object files.
    - A `c-lang` plugin, which adds support for C source sets and compiling them to object files
    - An `assembler-lang` plugin, which adds support for assembler source sets and compiling them to object files.
    - A `native-binaries` plugin, which adds the base support for native binaries and components.
    - 'cpp', 'c' and 'assembler' plugins, which apply the language plugin + native binary support
- Change `compilerArgs`, `define` and `macros` methods on NativeBinary so that they are language-specific
    - Replace existing methods with `cppCompiler.args`, `cppCompiler.define` and `cppCompiler.macros`.
    - Introduce `cCompiler` equivalents
- Change the GCC toolchain to use `gcc` to link when there is no C++ source included in a binary.

### Test cases

- Build breaks when C++ source file cannot be compiled.
- Build breaks when C source file cannot be compiled.
- Build breaks when a binary cannot be linked, for each type of binary.
- C compilation is incremental wrt C source files, header files and compiler settings.
- Mixed C/C++ binary, for each type of binary.
- Project has mixed C and C++ header files.
- Verify that C compiler is being used for C, and C++ compiler is being used for C++.
- Manually define C++ and C source sets.
- Can build a binary from C sources with `gcc` when `g++` and `as` are not installed

## Story: Build a binary from assembler source files

This story adds support for using assembler source files as inputs to a native binary.

- Add an `AssemblerSourceSet` type and allow these to be added to a native binary.
- Add an `Assemble` task type.
- Change the `cpp` plugin to add an `Assemble` instance for each assembler source set added to a native binary.
- Change the visual C++ toolchain to:
    - Use `ml /nologo /c` to assemble a source file to an object file.
- Change the GCC toolchain to:
    - Use `as` to assemble a source file to an object file.
- Add `NativeBinary.assembler.args` for providing arguments to the assembler

### Test cases

- Build breaks when source file cannot be assembled.
- Assembly is incremental wrt assembly source files, and assembler settings.
- Mixed C/C++/ASM binary, for each kind of binary
- A project can have all C, C++ source and header files and assembly source files in the same source directory.
- Manually define an assembler source set.

## Story: Introduce native functional source sets

This story reworks the existing C++ source set concepts to reuse the concept of a *functional* source set from the new JVM language DSL. This will allow a binary to be built from more than one language, and later stories will build on this to add support for specific languages.

- Change `CppSourceSet` to extend `LanguageSourceSet`.
- Add a mutable `NativeBinary.source` property of type `DomainObjectCollection<LanguageSourceSet>`.
    - Add a `NativeBinary.source` method that accepts a `FunctionalSourceSet` as input,
      and adds every `LanguageSourceSet` included in that functional source set.
- Change the C++ plugin to add a component's source sets to each of the component's binaries.
- Change the C++ plugin to add a `CppCompile` instance for each `CppSourceSet` added to a native binary.
- Change the `cpp` plugin to:
    - Add a `sources.${functionalSourceSet.name}.cpp` C++ source set for every functional source set.
- Change the `cpp-exe` and `cpp-lib` plugins to:
    - Add a `sources.main` functional source set
    - Wire the `sources.main.cpp` source set into the `main` executable/library.
- Remove `CppExtension`

### User visible changes

To adjust the by-convention layout:

    apply plugin: 'cpp-lib'

    sources {
        main {
            cpp {
                source.srcDirs = 'src'
            }
        }
    }

To define custom source sets and components:

    apply plugin: `cpp`

    sources {
        util {
        }
        app {
            cpp.libs << libraries.util
        }
        windows {
        }
    }

    libraries {
        util {
            source sources.util
        }
        app {
            source sources.app.cpp
        }
    }

### Test cases

- Assemble a binary for a component with no source.
- Assemble a binary for a component with multiple source sets.
- Assemble a binary from a functional source set.
- Assemble a binary from a cpp source set.
- Attempt to build a binary from a Java source set or a resource set.

## Story: Allow library binaries to be used as input to executable binaries

This story adds support for using another library component or binary as input to compile and/or link a given binary. Adding a library component or binary as input
implies that the library's header files will be available at compilation time, and the appropriate binaries available at link and runtime.

Some support will be added for expressing shared dependencies at the component level as well at the binary level.

Later stories will build on this to unify the library dependency DSL, so that a consistent approach is used to consume libraries built by the same project, or another
project in the same build, or from a binary repository.

- Rename `NativeDependencySet.files` to `runtimeFiles`.
- Add `NativeDependencySet.linkFiles`. Default implementation should return the runtime files. This will be improved in later stories.
- Change `DefaultStaticLibrary` so that the output file is called `lib${library.baseName}.a` when building with GCC on Windows.
- Add `LibraryBinary.getAsNativeDependencySet()`. The implementation depends on toolchain and binary type:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Binary type</th>
        <th>Toolchain</th>
        <th>linkFiles</th>
        <th>runtimeFiles</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>Shared</td><td>Visual C++</td><td>the `.lib` file</td><td>the `.dll` file</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Static</td><td>Visual C++</td><td>the `.lib` file</td><td>empty collection</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Shared</td><td>GCC</td><td>the `.so` or `.dll` file</td><td>the `.so` or `.dll` file</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Static</td><td>GCC</td><td>the `.a` file</td><td>empty collection</td></tr>
</table>

- The `includeRoots` property of the `NativeDependencySet` implementation for a binary should return the set of header directories exported by the library.
- Add `NativeBinary.libraries` property of type `DomainObjectCollection<NativeDependencySet>`.
- Change the C++ plugin to add the dependencies of each C++ source set to this collection.
- Change the C++ plugin to wire the inputs of the binary's compile and link tasks based on the contents of the `NativeBinary.libraries` collection.
- Add `Library.getShared()` and `getStatic()` methods which return `NativeDependencySet` implementations for the shared and static variants of the library.
- Add `NativeBinary.lib(Object)` method which accepts anything that can be converted to a `NativeDependencySet`:
    - A `NativeBinary` is converted by calling its `getAsNativeDependencySet()` method.
    - A `NativeDependencySet` can be used as is.
    - A `Library` is converted by calling its `getShared().getAsNativeDependencySet()` method.
- Add `CppSourceSet.lib(Object)` method which accepts the above types.

Note that this story does not include support for including the transitive dependencies of a library at link time and runtime.

    binaries {
        mainExecutable {
            // Include the static variant of the given library in the executable
            lib libraries.main.static
            // Include the default variant of the given library in the executable
            lib libraries.utils
            // Include the given binary in the executable
            lib binaries.someSharedLibrary
        }
    }

    cpp {
        sourceSets {
            main {
                lib libraries.main
                lib libraries.util.shared
                lib binaries.someSharedLibrary
            }
        }
    }

### Test cases

- Install and run an executable that:
    - Uses a mix of static and shared libraries.
    - Uses a mix of libraries from the same project, same build and from different builds.
    - In each case, verify that only shared libraries are included in the install image.
    - In each case, remove the original binaries before running the install image.
- A dependency on a binary overrides a dependency on the library that produced the binary.

# Milestone 2

## Story: Simplify configuration of component source sets

In the majority of cases, it makes sense to have a single named functional source set for each component, with
the source set name and source directory names matching the component name. This story ensures that such a source set
are created automatically for each component.

- Add a rule to the 'native-binaries' plugin that for each native component:
    - Creates a functional source set named with the component name, if such a source set does not yet exist.
    - Configures the functional source set to be a source input for the component.
- Remove explicit configuration and wiring of functional source sets for each component from tests and samples.

### Test cases

- Programmatically create the functional source set prior to adding the matching component.

## Story: Build different variants of a native component

This story adds initial support for building multiple variants of a native component. For each variant of a component, a binary of the appropriate type is defined.

- Add a `flavors` container to `NativeComponent`
- If no flavors are defined, then implicitly define a `default` flavor.
- Variants will be built for all available flavors:
    - With a single flavor, the binary task names and output directories will NOT contain the flavor name.
    - With multiple flavors, task names and output directories for each variant will include the flavor name.
- Add a property to `NativeBinary` to allow navigation to the flavor for this binary.
- When resolving the dependencies of a binary `b`, for a dependency on library `l`:
    - If `l` has multiple flavors defined, select the binary with the same flavor as `b`. Fail if no binary with matching flavor. Match flavors based on their name.
    - If `l` has a single flavor (default or defined), select the binary with that flavor.

### User visible changes

    libraries {
        main {
            flavors {
                main {}
                withOptionalFeature {}
            }
            binaries.matching { flavor == flavors.main } {
                cppCompiler.args '-DSOME_FEATURE
            }
        }
    }

This will define 4 binaries:

- library: 'main', flavor: 'main', packaging: 'static'
- library: 'main', flavor: 'main', packaging: 'shared'
- library: 'main', flavor: 'withOptionalFeature', packaging: 'static'
- library: 'main', flavor: 'withOptionalFeature', packaging: 'shared'

### Test cases

- Executable with flavors depends on a library with matching flavors.
    - Verify that each flavor of the executable can be built and is linked against the correct flavor of the library
- Executable with flavors depends on a library with no flavors
- Executable with flavors depends on a library with a single non-default flavor
- Executable depends on a library depends on another library. All have the same set of flavors
    - Verify that each flavor of the executable can be built and is linked against the correct flavor of the libraries.
- Executable with flavors depends on a library with a single flavor which depends on a library with flavors.
- Reasonable error message when:
    - Executable depends on a library with multiple flavors
    - Executable with flavors depends on a library with multiple flavors that do not match the executable's flavors.

### Open issues

- Need to consume locally and between projects and between builds.
- Need a hook to infer the default variant.
- Need to handle dependencies.
- Need to publish all variants.

## Story: Build a native component using multiple tool chains

This story adds support for building a native component using multiple tool chains. Each variant will have a tool chain associated with it.

- Build author can define a set of tool chain that may be used to build a component.
- If no tool chain is defined, then a single default tool chain will be used.
- From the set of defined tool chains, a set of available tool chains will be determined for building.
- Variants will be built for all available tool chains.
    - With a single defined tool chain, the binary task names and output directories will NOT contain the tool chain name.
    - With multiple defined tool chains, task names and output directories for each variant will include the tool chain name.
- When resolving the dependencies of a binary `b`, for a dependency on library `l`:
    - If `l` has multiple toolchains defined, select the binary with the same toolchain as `b`. Fail if no binary with matching toolchain. Match toolchains based on their name.
    - If `l` has a single toolchain, select the binary with that toolchain.
    - In both instances, assert that the toolchain for the selected binary is ABI compatible with the toolchain being used.
- When building component, will attempt to build variants for all available tool chains.

### User visible changes

        visualCpp(VisualCpp) {
            installDir "D:/Programs/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0"
        }
    }

### Tests

- With no toolchain defined, build on windows with Visual C++/MinGW/cygwin-gcc in path and on linux with gcc4/clang in path. (existing tests)
- Build with clang & gcc4 on Linux in a single invocation, with neither tool chain in path.
- Build with Visual C++, MinGW and GCC on Windows in a single invocation, with no tool chain in path.
- Reasonable error message when no tool chain is defined and default is not available.
- Reasonable error message any defined tool chain not available.
- Build an executable with multiple toolchains that uses a library with a single toolchain that uses a library with multiple toolchains.

## Story: Build a native component for multiple architectures

This story adds support for building a component for multiple architectures.
Introduce the concept of a native platform, which may have an associated architecture and operating system.
Each ToolChain can be asked if it can build for a particular platform.
Each variant has a platform associated with it.

- Native binaries plugin adds new types: `Architecture`, `Platform` and `PlatformContainer`.
    - Add an extension to `project` of type `PlatformContainer` named `targetPlatforms`.
- Add `architecture` property to `Platform`
    - If a platform has no architecture defined, then the architecture of the build machine is used.
    - If no target platform is defined and added to the PlatformContainer, then the a single default platform is added.
- Add a `platform` property to `NativeBinary` to allow navigation from the binary to its corresponding platform.
- Split `PlatformToolChain` out of `ToolChainInternal`, with `ToolChainInternal.target(Platform) -> PlatformToolChain`
    - `PlatformToolChain` may contain built-in knowledge of arguments required to build for target platform.
    - Additionally, platform-specific arguments may be supplied in the build script
- For each tool chain, a variant will be built for each defined platform. Later stories will allow a tool chain to only target certain platforms.
    - With a single defined platform, the binary task names and output directories will NOT contain the platform name.
    - With multiple defined platforms, task names and output directories for each variant will include the platform name.
- When resolving the dependencies of a binary `b`, for a dependency on library `l`:
    - If `l` has multiple platforms defined, select the binary with the same platform as `b`. Fail if no binary with matching platform. Match platforms based on their name.
    - If `l` has a single platform, select the binary with that platform.
    - In both instances, assert that the platform for the selected binary is compatible with the platform the binary is being built for
- Change the GCC and Visual C++ toolchain adapters to invoke the assembler, compiler, linker and static lib bundler with the appropriate architecture flags.
- Update the `c-with-assembler` sample to remove the command-line args and to use the DSL to select the appropriate source sets.

            // Customize arguments for all "x86_standard" and "x86_optimised" variants
        }
    }

### Tests

- For each supported toolchain, build a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit machine.
- Verify that the correct output was produced
    - On linux run `readelf` over the object files and binaries
    - On OS X run `otool -hv` over the object files and binaries
    - On Windows run `dumpbin` over the object files and binaries
- Build an executable with multiple architectures that uses a library with a single architecture that uses a library with multiple architectures.

## Story: Produce build type variants of a native component

This story adds support for building variants of a native component based on 'build type'.
The set of build types is user configurable, and for the purpose of this story, all build type customisations are specified in the build script.
Standard build types (debug/release) and build type compatibility will be handled in a subsequent story.

- NativeBinaries plugin adds a `buildTypes` container to the project.
- `BuildType` is a simple type extending `Named` with no additional properties.
- If no build types are configured, add a single default build type named `debug`
- Build a variant Native Binary for each defined build type. Add a property to NativeBinary to allow navigation to the defined `buildType`.
    - With a single defined (or default) build type, the binary task names and output directories will NOT contain the build type.
    - With multiple defined build types, task names and output directories for each variant will include the build type.
- When resolving the dependencies of a binary `b`, for a dependency on library `l`:
    - Select a binary for library `l` that has a build type with a matching name.

## Story: Use GCC to cross-compile for custom target platforms

This story adds support for cross-compilation with GCC. It adds the concept of a 'platform configuration' to be supplied to a tool chain,
specifying arguments to use with GCC when targeting a particular platform.

- Add `TargetPlatformConfiguration` that defines the set of tool arguments that should be provided to the tool chain
  when building for a target platform.
- Add `Gcc.addPlatformConfiguration(TargetPlatformConfiguration)` to add target platform support to a tool chain.
- Add `ToolChainInternal.canTargetPlatform(Platform)` to determine if a particular tool chain supports building for a particular
  target platform.
  - For GCC 'i386' and 'x86_64' will have built-in support.
  - For Visual C++, the supported platforms is not extensible. Support is limited to 'i386', 'x86_64' and 'ia64'.

## Story: Build a native component for multiple operating systems

This story adds the concept of an operating system to the platform. A tool chain may only be able to build for a particular
target operating system, an for GCC additional support may be added to target an operating system.

- Add `OperatingSystem` and simple type extending Named
- Add `Platform.operatingSystem` property. Default is the default target operating system of the tool chain.
    - Can configure the operating system with a string arg to `Platform.operatingSystem()`: a set of standard names will map to
      windows, linux, osx and solaris.

### User visible changes

    targetPlatforms {
        linux_x86 {
            operatingSystem "linux"
            architecture "x86"
        }
        linux_x64 {
            operatingSystem "linux"
            architecture "x64"
        }

        }
        itanium {
            architecture "IA-64"
            // Use the tool chain default operating system
        }
    }

## Story: Incremental compilation for C and C++

### Implementation

There are two approaches to extracting the dependency information from source files: parse the source files looking for `#include` directives, or
use the toolchain's preprocessor.

For Visual studio, can run with `/P` and parse the resulting `.i` file to extract `#line nnn "filename"` directives. In practise, this is pretty slow.
For example, a simple source file that includes `Windows.h` generates 2.7Mb in text output.

For GCC, can run with `-M` or `-MM` and parse the resulting make file to extract the header dependencies.

The implementation will also remove stale object files.

### Test cases

- Change a header file that is included by one source file, only that source file is recompiled.
- Change a header file that is not included by any source files, no compilation or linking should happen.
- Change a header file that is included by another header file.
- Change a compiler setting, all source files are recompiled.
- Remove a source file, the corresponding object file is removed.
- Rename a source file, the corresponding object file is removed.
- Remove all source files, all object files and binary files are removed.

## Story: Modify command line arguments for binary tool prior to execution

This story provides a 'hook' allowing the build author to control the exact set of arguments passed to a tool chain executable.
This will allow a build author to work around any limitations in Gradle, or incorrect assumptions that Gradle makes.
The arguments hook should be seen as a 'last-resort' mechanism, with preference given to truly modelling the underlying domain.

### User visible changes

    toolChains {
        gcc(Gcc) {
            cppCompiler.withArgs { List<String> args ->
                Collections.replaceAll(args, "-m32", "-march=i386")
            }
            linker.withArgs { List<String> args ->
                if (args.remove("-lstdc++")) {
                    args << "-lstdc++"
                }
            }
        }
    }

### Implementation

- Change the mechanism for transforming a spec to arguments, so that first we create a list of arguments, then we apply
  a series of transformations.
- Add `GccTool.withArgs(Action<List<String>>)`, which adds a transformation early in the series (before writing option file).

### Test cases

- Test with custom placeholder argument that is replaced by a GCC argument via GccTool.withArgs(). Do this for each tool (cppCompiler, cCompiler, linker, assembler, archiver).
- Test adds bad argument to args for binary: arg is removed by hook.

### Open Issues

- Similar functionality for Visual C++
- Use only 'g++' and 'gcc' frontends for GCC (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/172587/what-is-the-difference-between-g-and-gcc)

## Story: Allow sources to be specified that apply to a particular Target Platform

In some cases, different sources should be used depending on ToolChain or Target Platform. Assembler sources are almost always different
for different platforms. This story will allow different sources to be used to build a Native Binary depending on the target platform.

## Story: Build native binaries with Visual C++ that target different Windows SDK versions

## Story: Influence which variant is chosen for a library dependency

This story adds the ability to define the variant attributes that should be matched when resolving a library dependency to a binary.
For now, it will be possible to specify the linkage, flavor, buildType and platform of the variant. These values will be specified
as string selectors, which will be matched to the respective attributes of each candidate binary.

When a variant attribute is not specified, it will be matched to the consuming binary.

### User visible changes

    sources.main.cpp {
        lib(libraries.hello) {
            linkage "static"
            flavor "chocolate"
            buildType "debug-optimised"
            platform "x86_64"
        }
    }
    executables {
        main {}
    }

### Test cases:

- Executable with single flavor chooses which flavor of library to link
- Executable chooses custom buildType for static library variant
- Build fails when executable attempts to define multiple selection criteria for same library

### Open issues:

- Handle multiple definitions of selection criteria for the same library
- Allow different library variants to be selected for different consuming variants
- Need a way to define rules like: 'use all static variants'

## Story: Allow library binaries to be used as input to other libraries

This story add support for using a library which has dependencies on other libraries.

Given a library `a` that uses another library `b` as input:

- When compiling a binary that uses library `a`, then include the exported headers for library `a` but not the headers for library `b`.
- The link-time files of a shared library `a`, are the link binaries for shared library `a` only (the `.so` or the `.lib` file).
- The link-time files of a static library `a`, are the link binaries for static library `a` (the `.a` or `.lib` file) and the link-time files of its direct dependencies.
- The runtime files of a shared library `a`, are the runtime binaries for shared library `a` (the `.so` or the `.dll` file) and the runtime files of its direct dependencies.
- The runtime files of a static library `a`, are the runtime files of its direct dependencies.

- Change the native model to use deferred configuration:
    - Configure a source set completely before using it as input to a component or binary.
    - Configure a component completely before using it as a source set dependency or defining its binaries.
    - Configure a binary completely before defining tasks for it.
    - Configure a component completely before defining tasks for it.

### Test cases

- Install and run an executable that:
    - Use a (static, shared) library that depends on another (static, shared) library.
    - In each case, verify that only shared libraries are included in the install image.
    - In each case, remove the original binaries before running the install image.

### Open issues

- Need to apply conflict resolution as we can't include the static and shared binaries for a given library at link time.
- Need to be able to deal with the fact that only position-independent binaries can be linked into position-independent binaries
    - Make it possible to build a position-independent variant of a static library binary
    - Add the '-fPIC' flag when compiling to ensure that the static library can be included in a shared library
    - Change dependency resolution to choose the position-independent variant of a static library when linking into a shared library
- Need a new name for `NativeDependencySet`.
- Need some way to convert a `NativeDependencySet` to a read-only library.
- Need to apply a lifecycle to the resolved libs of `CppSourceSet` and `NativeBinary`.
- Improve consumption of libraries from other projects.
- Some mechanism to use the static binary as default for a library.
- Some mechanism to select static or dynamic linkage for each dependency of a binary.
- Infer incoming libraries from component dependencies.
- Samples that demonstrates how to link a static library into an executable.
- Move Component and Binary interfaces to new packages.
- Add some way to create ad hoc `NativeDependencySet` instances, for example, a library produced by another build tool.
- Need to be able to fine-tune compile time, link time and runtime inputs.
- Merge `CppSourceSet.lib()` and `CppSourceSet.dependency()`.
- Allow a `Binary` to be attached to a publication.
- Update publication so that a binary's include, link and runtime files are published.

## Story: Variant aware dependency resolution

Depends on a number of stories in [dependency-resolution.md](dependency-resolution.md). The plan is roughly:

- Dependency resolution is based on resolving a graph of components.
- Model native components as a `SoftwareComponent`.
- Model dependencies on native components as a dependency declaration.
- Introduce a way to create a set of dependency declarations, and a way to resolve a set to a graph of components.
- Allow a the native language plugins to provide the rules for selecting the dependencies and artifacts for a native component.
- Replace `DependentSourceSet.libs` and `dependency` with a set of dependency declarations.
- Replace `LibraryResolver` and `NativeDependencySet` with the above.

## Story: Allow easy creation of all variants, all possible variants and a single variant for each component

- Add an `assemble` lifecycle task for each component.
- Running `gradle assemble` should build all binaries for the main executable or library
- Running `gradle uploadArchives` should build and publish all binaries for the main executable or library
- Add a task for creating a single 'developer image' for each component.
    - Build `debug` variant where possible
    - Build shared library variants
    - Build for the current Operating System and architecture

## Story: Support Clang compiler

### Test cases

- Build all types of binaries from all supported languages using Clang.
- Change test apps to detect which compiler is used to compile and assert that the correct compiler is being used.

## Story: Allow a binary to be defined that is not part of a component

- Allow native binary instances to be added manually.
- Change `NativeBinary` so that not every binary has an associated component.

### Test cases

- Can define a standalone executable, shared library or static library binary, and the appropriate tasks are created and configured appropriately.
- Can define and configure standalone compile and link tasks.

## Story: Convenient configuration of compiler and linker settings

### Open issues

- Add properties to set macros and include directories for a binary, allow these to be set as toolchain specific compiler args (ie -D and -I) as well.
- Add properties to set system libs and lib directories for a binary, allow these to be set as toolchain specific linker args (ie -l and -L) as well.
- Add set methods for each of these properties.

## Story: Link Windows resource files into native binaries

Allow resource files to be linked into a Windows binary.

This story adds a new `windows-resources` plugin which adds support for compiling and linking resource files into a native binary. Windows resource will be treated
as another native language, and the plugin will follow a similar pattern to the C and C++ language plugins.

Here's an example:

    apply plugin: `windows-resources`

    sources {
        myExe {
            rc {
                include '**/*.rc'
            }
        }
    }

    executables {
        myExe
    }

1. Add a `windows-resources` plugin. This will follow a similar pattern as the `cpp` and `c` plugins (see `CppPlugin` for example). For now, this can do nothing.
2. Add a `WindowsResourcesSet` which extends `LanguageSourceSet`.
3. For each `FunctionalSourceSet`, the `windows-resources` plugin defines a `WindowsResourceSet` called `rc` (see `CppLangPlugin` for example).
4. Add a `WindowsResourcesCompile` task type. For now, this can do nothing.
5. For each `WindowsResourceSet` added as input to a `NativeBinary`, then the `windows-resources` plugin:
    - If target platform is not Windows, ignores the source set.
    - If target platform is Windows, adds a `WindowsResourceCompile` task which takes as input all of the resource files in the source set.
      Naming scheme as per the other language plugins (see `CppNativeBinariesPlugin` for example).
6. The `WindowsResourcesCompile` task compiles source resources to `.res` format:
    - For the gcc/clang toolchains, should use [`windres`](http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/windres.html) to compile each source file.
    - For the Visual C++ toolchain, should use [`rc`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa381055.aspx) to compile each source file.
    - Should implement this by adding a new tool method on `PlatformToolChain`.
7. Include the resulting `.res` files as input to the link task  (see `CppNativeBinariesPlugin` for example).
8. For each `NativeBinary`, the `windows-resources` plugin defines a `PreprocessingTool` extension called `rcCompiler` (see `CppNativeBinariesPlugin` for example).
    - If the target platform is not Windows, do not add.
    - Wire up the args and macros defined in this extension as defaults for the resource compile task.
9. Add a sample

### Test cases

- Can compile and link multiple resource files into an executable and a shared library.
    - Possibly use a STRING resource and the `LoadString()` function to verify that the resources are included.
    - Possibly find some tool that can query the resources linked into a binary and use this.
- Can define preprocessor macros and provide command-line args to `rc` and `windres`.
- Compilation and linking is incremental wrt resource source files and resource compiler args.
- Stale `.res` files are removed when a resource source file is renamed.
- User receives a reasonable error message when resource compilation fails.
- Can create a resources-only executable and shared library.
- Resource source files are ignored on non-Windows platforms.

### Open issues

- Source set with srcdirs + patterns probably does not work for resource files
- For a static library, the .res file forms part of the library outputs
- Generate and link a version resource by convention into every binary?
- Include headers?
- Don't define the compile task if the source set is empty.

# Milestone 3

## Story: Generate source from Microsoft IDL files

- Add a `microsoft-idl` plugin
- For each `FunctionalSourceSet` add an IDL source set.
- Add the IDL source set as input to the C source set.
- Add some way to declare what type of thing is being built: RPC client, RPC server, COM component, etc
- For each IDL source set adds a generate task for each target architecture
    - Not on Windows
    - Fail if toolchain is not Visual C++
    - Use `midl` to generate server, client and header source files.
        - Invoke with `/env win32` or `/env amd64` according to target architecture.
        - Invoke with `/nologo /out <output-dir>`
- Add `midl` macros and args to each `NativeBinary` with Windows as the target platform
- Add a sample

### Test cases

- Can build a client and server executable.
- Can build a COM DLL.
- Incremental
- Removes stale `.c` and `.h` files

### Open issues

- Source set with srcdirs + patterns probably does not work for IDL files.
- Include headers?
- Need to make `LanguageSourceSet` extend `BuildableModelElement`.

## Story: Use Windows linker def files

### Implementation

* A `.def` file lists `__stdcall` functions to export from a DLL. Can also use `__declspec(dllexport)` in source to export a function.
* Functions are imported from a DLL using `__declspec(dllimport)`.

## Story: Build binaries against a library in another project

### Open issues

- When linking a native binary, link against exactly the same version of each library that we compiled against, plus any additional link-time dependencies (resources, for example).
- When installing a native executable, also install exactly the same versions of each library that we linked against, plus any additional runtime dependencies.

## Story: Support CUnit test execution

### Use cases

### Implementation

Generally, C++ test frameworks compile and link a test launcher executable, which is then run to execute the tests.

To implement this:
* Define a test source set and associated tasks to compile, link and run the test executable.
* It should be possible to run the tests for all architectures supported by the current machine.
* Generate the test launcher source and compile it into the executable.
* It would be nice to generate a test launcher that is integrated with Gradle's test eventing.
* It would be nice to generate a test launcher that runs test cases detected from the test source (as we do for JUnit and TestNG tests).

### Open issues

* Need a `unitTest` lifecycle task, plus a test execution task for each variant of the unit tests.
* Unit test executable needs to link with the object files that would be linked into the main executable.
* Need to exclude the `main` method.

## Story: Expose only public header files for a library

TBD

## Story: Visual studio integration

### Implementation

* Allow the visual studio project file to be generated.
* Merge with existing project file, as for IDEA and Eclipse.
* Add hooks for customizing the generated XML.

# Bugfixes

## Files with identical names in C/C++ source tree are silently excluded from compilation (GRADLE-2923)

### Implementation

* Change C++ and C compiler implementations (GCC and VisualCpp) so that only a single sources file is compiled per execution 
    * Create a single compiler options file to reuse for compiling all source files
    * For each source file specify the source file name and the output file name on the command line
* Make the generated object file include the project-relative path to the source file
    * For a source file that is located within the project directory, use the project relative path
    * For a source file that is located outside of the project directory, use the absolute path to the source file, appropriately escaped
* Update `OutputCleaningCompiler` with knowledge of the new source->object file mapping

If we are inspired by CMake, the output file rules would be:

* For a source file found at `src/main/cpp/main.cpp`, create the object file `build/objectFiles/<component>/<sourceSet>/src/main/cpp/main.cpp.obj`
* For a source file found at `../../src/main/cpp/main.cpp`, create the object file `build/objectFiles/<component>/<sourceSet>/C_/dev/gradle/samples/native-binaries/cpp-exe/src/main/cpp/main.cpp.obj`

### Test cases

* Source set includes files with the same name located within project directory
* Source set includes files with the  files with the same name where 1 is located outside the project directory
* Removes stale outputs when source file is moved to a different directory

### Open issues

* Nice way between a project directory and an absolute directory with the same path

# Milestone 4

## Story: Automatically include debug symbols in 'debug' build types

- Add a `debug` property to `BuildType`. The default 'debug' build type should have `debug == true`.
- Gcc should compile sources for `debug` build types with the `-g` flag
- Visual C++ should
    - Compile sources for `debug` build types with `/Zi /DDEBUG` and non-debug build types with `/DNDEBUG`.
    - Link binaries for `debug` build types with `/DEBUG` and non-debug build types with `/RELEASE`.
- When resolving the dependencies of a binary `b`, for a dependency on library `l`:
    - Prefer a binary for library `l` that has a build type with a matching name.
    - Otherwise, select a library `l` that has a build type with a matching `debug` flag.

## Story: Publish and resolve shared libraries

### Use cases

A producer project produces a single shared library, for a single platform. The library depends on zero or more other dynamic libraries.
The library is published to a repository.

A consumer project resolves the library from the repository, and links an executable against it. Some libraries may be installed on the consumer
machine, and the remaining libraries are available in a repository.

Out of scope is the publishing of the resulting executable (this is a later story, below).

### Implementation

On some platforms, such as UNIX platforms, linking is done against the shared library binary. On Windows, linking is done
against the library's export file (`.lib`), which is created when the library is linked.

On most platforms, the name of the binary file is important, and at runtime must match the name that was used at link time. On UNIX platforms,
the so_name (or install_path on OS X) that is built into the library binary is used. If not present, the absolute path of the library binary file
is used. This means that in order to execute against a shared library.

Generally, this means that the library must be installed in some form before it can be linked against.

To implement this story:

* Producer project publishes the dependency meta-data for the library.
* Producer project published the library's export file (.lib) when building on Windows.
* Consumer project uses correct names for resolved libraries.
* Consumer project sets the UNIX file executable permission for resolved executables on UNIX filesystems.
* Separate out compile, link and runtime dependencies, so that different artifacts can be used at compile, link and runtime.
* Consumer project installs the libraries into a location where the executable can find them, with their correct names, and uses these locations
  at link time.
* Consumer determine which libraries are already installed on the machine, and uses these from their installed location at link time.
* Define some standard artifact types for shared libraries, header archives and export files.

## Story: Publish and resolve executables

### Use cases

A producer project produces a single executable, for a single platform. The executable depends on zero or more shared libraries.
The executable is published to a repository.

A consumer project resolves the executable from the repository, and executes it. Some libraries may be installed on the consumer machine, and the
remaining libraries are available in a repository.

### Implementation

On most platforms, executables must follow a certain platform-specific convention. On UNIX platforms, for example, the executable must have the execute
permission set. On Windows platforms, the executable should have a `.exe` extension.

To implement this:

* There are a number of tasks in common with [publishing and resolving shared libraries](#shared-libraries) above.
* Producer project publishes the dependency meta-data for the executable.
* Consumer project uses correct names for resolved executables.
* Consumer project sets the UNIX file executable permission for resolved executables on UNIX filesystems.
* Consumer project installs the executable and libraries into a location where they are executable.
* Define some standard artifact types for executables.

## Story: Binaries built for multiple Intel x86 architectures

### Use cases

A producer project compiles and links a shared library for multiple Intel x86 architectures, for a single operating system. The library has zero or
more dependencies. The library is published to a repository.

A consumer project links and runs an executable against the appropriate variant of the library, resolved from the repository.

Out of scope for this work is support for other chipsets, or projects that build a library for multiple chipsets.

### Implementation

There are 2 main parts to the architecture that we are interested in: The CPU instruction set that is being used, and the data model. Usually,
but not always, a 32-bit processor instruction set is used with 32-bit data model, and a 64-bit processor instruction set is used with 64-bit
data model.

Usually, it is possible to combine different instruction sets in the same binary. So, when linking a binary targeting the amd64 CPU, it is fine to link
against a library built for the x86 CPU. It is not possible to combine different data models in the same executable.

On OS X, a binary may target multiple architectures, as a universal binary. It should be noted that a universal binary simply supports more than one
architectures, but not necessarily every architecture as the name suggests. For example, a universal binary might include x86 & amd64 support but no
ppc or ppc64 support.

File names are important here. Generally, architecture is not encoded in the binary file name. The build must be able to distinguish between binaries
that have the same file name (and install path) but are built for different architectures.

It is not always possible to build the binaries for more than one architecture on a given machine. On Linux machines, the system libraries for the
target architecture must be installed and available for linking. On Windows machines, a separate compiler must be used for each architecture.

To implement this:

* Add appropriate tasks so that producer project can compile, link and publish the binaries for all available architectures in a single build invocation.
* Add some mechanism for the developer to select the architectures they are interested in from the command-line and tooling API.
* Include in the published meta-data information about which (CPU + data model) each binary was built for.
* Consumer project selects the binaries with the appropriate (CPU + data model) when resolving the link and runtime dependencies for the executable.
* Allow compiler and linker settings to be specified for each architecture.
* Allow resolved binaries to have the same file name across architectures. For example, a shared library should be called `libsomething.so` regardless
  of whether it happens to be built for the x86 or amd64 architectures.
* Define some standard names for CPU instruction sets and architectures, plus mappings to platform specific names.
* Define some default architectures for the x86 chipset. So, every C++ binary may be built for the x86 and amd64 architectures by default.

To generate the binaries:

* For windows, run the 'x86' or 'x86_amd64' compiler.
* For linux + intel CPU, run with gcc with -m32 or -m64.
* For OS X, run gcc with -arch i386, -arch x86_64, -arch ppc, -arch ppc64. Can include multiple times to generate a universal binary. Need to fix
  GRADLE-2431.

Native architecture names:

* OS X: i386, x86_64, ppc, ppc64

## Story: Binaries built for multiple operating systems

### Use cases

A producer project compiles, links and publishes a shared library for multiple combinations of operating system and architecture. The library depends
on zero or more shared libraries. The library is published to a repository.

A consumer project compiles, links and runs an executable against the library.

Out of scope is cross compilation for other platforms, or building binaries for multiple versions of the same operating system.

### Implementation

Generally, a given machine will not be able to build the binaries for all target operating systems. This means that multiple coordinated builds will
be involved.

For the purposes of this story, this coordination will be manual. A human or CI server will trigger a number of builds, each of which builds a subset of
the binaries and uploads them. Finally, a build that uploads the meta-data and other operating system independent binaries (header, jars, source and so on) will
be triggered. See [this story](#single-build) for a description of how this will be improved.

This multi-build approach will also be used to allow binaries for multiple chipsets, and for multiple operating system versions, to be built. There are
currently no stories for these use cases.

There are two aspects of operating system that we are interested in: the operating system + version. The version is really a proxy for other attributes
we don't model yet: system calling convention, ABI version, language runtime version, which system APIs are available, and so on.

File names are important here. Often, the platform is not encoded int the file name. The build must handle binaries that have the same name (and
install path) but are built for different operating systems.

To implement this:

* Add appropriate tasks so that the producer project can compile, link and publish the binaries for the current machine's operating system.
* Allow the binaries for a given version of the library to be built and published from multiple machines.
* Include in the published meta-data information about which operating system + version each binary was built for.
* Consumer project selects the binaries for the appropriate operating system when resolving link and runtime dependencies for the executable.
* Allow compiler and linker settings to be specified for each operating system.
* Allow dependencies to be declared for each operating system.
* Allow the producer to declare a dependency on operating system version (or range, more likely).
* Allow resolved binaries to have the same file name across operating system.
* Define some standard operating system names.

## Story: Header-only libraries

### Use case

Producer project publishes a library consisting of header files only (e.g. a library of C++ template classes).

Consumer project compiles an executable against this library.

### Implementation

To implement this:

* Allow zero or more binaries for a given library at link and runtime. Also allow for zero or more header files.

## Story: Debug and release binaries

### Use case

Producer project publishes a shared library with both debug and release variants.

Consumer project compiles, links and debugs an executable against this library.

### Implementation

Implementation-wise, this problem is similar in some respects to handling multiple architectures.

Usually, it is fine to link a release build of a library into a debug binary, if the debug variant is not available. It is not fine to link a debug
build of a library into a release binary. On Windows, it is not ok to link a release build of a library into a debug binary.

On some platforms, additional artifacts are required to debug a binary. On gcc based platforms, the debug information is linked into the binary.
On Windows, the debug information is contained in a separate program database file (`.pdb`).

On all platforms, the source files for the binary are required.

To implement this:

* Producer project publishes the program database file (.pdb) for Windows binaries.
* Producer project publishes the source files for the library.
* Include in the published meta-data, information about whether the binary is a release or debug binary.
* Separate out debug time dependencies from runtime.
* Consumer project selects the appropriate release or debug library binaries when resolving link, execute and debug dependencies.
* Consumer project installs the pdb and source files into the appropriate locations, so the debugger can find them.
* Allow compiler and linker settings to be specified separately for release and debug binaries.
* Define a set of default build types (debug and release, say).
* Allow the producer and consumer projects to define custom build types.

To generate the release binaries (default):
* Enable conservative optimisations.
* Compile with -DNDEBUG
* Compile with -g0

To generate the debug binaries (default):
* Disable optimisation.
* Compile with -g or /Zi
* Link with /DEBUG

## Story: Publish and resolve static libraries

### Use cases

Publisher project publishes a shared library.

Consumer project compiles, links and publishes a shared library that includes the shared library.

### Implementation

To implement this:

* Add tasks to the publisher project to allow both static and shared library binaries to be built and published.
* Include in the published meta-data, information about which static libraries are linked statically into the binary.
* Consumer project selects either the static or dynamic binaries for a given dependency at link time. A dependency that is statically linked
  into a binary has no files that are required at runtime, but may have files that are required at debug time.

## Story: Publish multiple binaries from a project

TBD

## Story: Build binaries for all operating systems in a single build

TBD

## DSL cleanups

- Improve customising the tasks for building a binary
- Improve doing stuff with the install task
- Some way to configure/use all native components (instead of `libraries.all { ... }` and `components.all { ... }`)
- Have some way to replace the default source sets or configure one without redefining all
- Don't create variants that can never be built
- Allow a plugin to define the set of available tool chains, build types, platforms, flavors etc and allow a component to declare which of these make sense.
  Tool chain is NOT a dimension: Can infer tool chain from target platform and source dialect
- Model language dialect and add this to source set, e.g. GCC, visual C++, ANSI C. A tool chain can compile some set of dialects.
- Model operating system as a dependency declared by a source set.
    - Can use this to determine which source sets to include in a given binary.
- Model ABI as part of platform. A tool chain can produce binaries for some set of ABIs.
- Use the term 'Visual Studio' consistently instead of 'Visual C++'
- Test coverage for Visual studio 2012, 2013
- Tool chain represents an installation. Must be easy to configure the discovered tool chain, and configure extra installations.
- Improve name spacing in the DSL, so that only the current thing (or no thing) is reachable without some kind of qualification.

## Source

- Replace `SourceDirectorySet` with something that is actually a set of source directories.
    - Use this for sources and headers
    - Can access as a set of directories, a set of files or a file tree
    - Allow individual files to be added
    - Allow custom file extensions to be specified
- Source sets are children of components
- Cpp source set should include only files with a C++ extension
- C source set should include only files with a C extension
- Assembler source set should include only files with an assembler extension
- A native component has a shared headers source set with its own dependencies, visible to all source sets of the component
- A source set may have private headers and its own dependencies, visible only to the source set
- A library component has an API, defaults to the shared headers
- When compiling, only the API of dependencies should be visible
- AssemblerSourceSet should implement DependentSourceSet (has source dependencies)
- Add source sets only to a component, have some way to describe how to include/exclude a source set
- Some conventional location for os specific source for a component

## Compilation

- GRADLE-2943 - Fix escaping of compiler and linker args
- Understand and/or model -I/-L/-l/-D/-U
- GCC tool-chain uses gcc/g++ to link and gcc to assemble
- Source set declares a target language runtime, use this to decide which driver to use to link
- Don't fail if g++ is not installed when it is not required
- Support preprocessor macros for assembler
- Understand build and release build types and drive the compiler and linker appropriately

## Target platforms

- Separate the model for how you select a target platform, and the details of a particular target platform.
    - Use an alias or some kind of selector to define which target platforms to build for.
    - Selector can select multiple target platforms
- Define some conventions for platforms, along with some conventions for aliases/selectors and names
- Conventional architecture names
    - Intel 32bit: `ia-32`, `i386`, `x86`
    - Intel 64bit: `x86-64`, `x64` (Windows), `amd64` (BSD and Debian linux distributions, Solaris), `x86_64` (linux kernel, OS X, Fedora, GCC tools)
    - Intel Itanium: `ia-64`
    - PowerPC 32bit: `ppc`
    - PowerPC 64bit: `ppc64`
    - Sparc: ??
    - ARM: ??
- Conventional operating system names
- Infer the default target platform, as the current operating system and a 'standard' architecture for that operating system on the current machine.

## Variants

- Add linkage as a variant dimension
- Model build type better, follow the same pattern as target platform
- Define some conventional build types (say `release` and `debug`). Have the tool chain and dependency resolution understand these.
- Model flavors better, follow the same pattern as other variant dimensions.
- Need to handle universal binaries.
    - Use `lipo` to merge two binaries into a single universal binary.
    - Transforms the meta-data for the component - same set of variants but different set of binaries.

## Toolchains

- DSL to declare that a toolchain supports certain target platform, and how to invoke the tools to do so.


    toolchains {
        gcc {
            platform(...) {
                ... configure platform implementation
                cppCompiler { compileSpec ->
                    ... compiler compiler invocation
                }
            }
        }
        visualStudio {
            ...
        }
        gcc3(Gcc) {
            installDir = 'someWhere'
        }
    }

## Structure

- Some common plugin that determines which tool-chains to apply
- Fix package hierarchy

### Language plugins

- Add a 'development' install task, which chooses a single variant for an executable to install
- Need to make standard 'build', 'check' lifecycle tasks available too. The `assemble` task should build all buildable variants.
    - Reasonable behaviour when nothing is buildable on the current machine.
- Come up with consistent naming scheme for language plugins: 'cpp', 'c', 'assembler', 'java-lang', 'scala-lang', etc

### Performance

- Improve incremental build where the task needs to do some work to figure out the inputs.
- Add some performance tests
- Parallel compilation, some kind of consistency between parallel test execution, parallel task execution, etc.

## Later

- Better way to see how the compiler is being invoked
- Make names less important

# Open issues

* Output of any custom post link task should be treated as input to anything that depends on the binary.
* Add 'position independent' setting to 'NativeBinary'.
* Add a position independent variant for all static libraries.
* Model shared/static linkage as another dimension for library components.
* Handling for system libraries.
* Building for multiple chipsets.
* Selecting a compatible architecture at resolve time. For example, if I'm building for the amd64 cpu, I can use an x86 cpu + 64 bit data model.
* Selecting a compatible operating system version at resolve time.
* Selecting a compatible release binary when the debug binaries are not available.
* Need to include meta-data about which runtime an DLL is linked against. Same for UNIX shared libraries, but less common.
* Need to include meta-data about which optimisation level a binary is compiled for.
* Cross compilation.
* Custom variants.
* Calling convention.
* Can in theory share the compile task between a static library and an executable built from the same source.
* Publishing and resolving RPM/DEB/NuGet/pkg-config/ etc.
* Support for profiling builds: build with profiling enabled, execute a bunch of times, then build again using the profiling information.
* Support for install distributions, which may bundle some, all, or none of the runtime dependencies (including language runtime libraries).
* Understand the various output file types: PE, ELF, Mach-O, COFF
* Bare-bones tool chain using GNU binutils
* Should be able to run the C preprocessor on assembler source file.
* Should use the registry to find visual C++ and SDK.
* Add support for cygwin-64 (uses a different data model to windows) and mingw under cygwin.
* Install task should generate a shell script as well as a batch script when running under cygwin.
* GCC and Clang under cygwin target the cygwin runtime, not the windows runtime.
* Add language level to C and C++ source sets.
* The `gcc` provided by XCode on OS X is actually a repackaged `clang`. Should distinguish between building with the `gcc` provided by XCode, and building with a real `gcc`
  install, eg via a ports toolkit.
* Adding other languages as external plugins
