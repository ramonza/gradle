command line options & task configuration

# Use cases

1. User selects the dependency criteria to run dependency reports for.
2. User selects which tests to include/exclude for test execution.
3. User requests that tests be executed with debugging enabled.
4. User specifies which Gradle version to perform an upgrade comparison build against.
5. User specifies which Gradle version the wrapper should use.

## State of things

State of things now: There's an internal `@CommandLineOption(options='theOption', description='some description')` annotation that:

1. Makes `theOption` usable on command line via `--theOption`
2. Works only with Strings and booleans setters (e.g. `setTheOption()`), which are annotated with `@CommandLineOption`

# Stories

## Improve error handling

### User visible changes

Nice messages when user incorrectly uses a command line option.

### Test coverage

1. all acceptance criteria
1. works if there are extra unrelated, non-configurable tasks
1. works in a multi-project build

### Implementation approach / acceptance criteria

1. None of the potential user mistakes listed below should lead to an internal error.
1. Current command line options are not handled consistently at the moment.
    For example, --offline works same as -offline, but --ofline (typo) does not work the same as -ofline
1. Fix issue where an unknown option leads to an internal error.
1. Nice error reporting for:
    1. misspelled option(s).
    1. options required but not provided.
    1. option needs a value (e.g. String) but none provided.
    1. options that must not have value (e.g. boolean options) but value was provided
    1. single '-' used instead of '--'
    1. option used but there are no tasks that accept this configuration option
    1. clashing options, e.g. no-value boolean option in one task is a string option in other task
1. When a value has not been specified for a required task property and that property has a `@CommandLineOption` annotation, then the validation error
   message should inform the user that they can use the specified option to provide a value.

## Make the feature public

### User visible changes

TBD

### Test coverage

TBD

### Implementation approach

1. Make sure we're happy with the notation. Current one is:
 `some_task some_configurable_task --some_option --some_option2 optional_option2_value some_other_task`
 I'm worried that without some kind of namespacing we'll run into problems in the long run.
2. Move the `@CommandLineOption` annotation to the public API and mark `@Incubating`.
3. Add documentation to 'implementing custom tasks` chapter.
4. Use `NotationParser` to convert from command-line option to method parameter type.
5. Support annotating a Groovy task field.
6. Support multiple values for `CommandLineOption.options()` or replace `options()` with singular `option()`.
7. Support zero args methods annotated with `@CommandLineOption`.
8. Add validation for methods with `@CommandLineOption`:
    * The method must take exactly zero or one parameters.
    * The parameter must be of type boolean or assignable from String or assignable from Boolean.
9. Add error reporting for:
    * Configuration method throws an exception.
    * Annotation is missing 'options' value.
    * Annotation is missing 'description' value.

## Help task shows basic details about a task

Add some command line interface for discovering details about a task (name, type, path, description)

### User visible changes

Running `gradle help --task test` shows a usage message for the `test` task.

If multiple tasks match, details of the matching tasks are shown

* all matched tasks have the same type
    * print one report of the task type and include all matching paths in the report

* matched tasks have different types
    * print one detail output for each different task type including all available paths

### Test coverage

* integration tests
    * `gradle help --task` on simple task
    * `gradle help --task` on task referenced by full path  (e.g. `:someProj:dependencies`)
    * `gradle help --task` on implicit task task
    * `gradle help --task` on task defined via placeholder
    * `gradle help --task` on non existing task displays reasonable error message, including candidate matches
    * `gradle help --task` on multiple matching tasks
    * `gradle help --task` using camel-case matching to select task

### Implementation approach

- Change the `help` task:
    - add `--task` commandline property
    - change displayHelp implementation to print task details when `--task` is set
    - lookup project tasks and implicit tasks using the task selector
    - throw decent error message when requested task cannot be found
    - task details (task name, task type, path)
    - the default message informs the user about using `gradle help --task n`

- Update the 'using Gradle from the command-line' user guide chapter to mention the help task.

## Help task shows command-line options for a task

Commandline options of the task passed to help are listed including a description. The legal values for each property are not shown - this
is added in a later story.

### User visible changes

The usage message of running `gradle help --task <task>` lists commandline options of the selected tasks.

### Test coverage

* integration tests
    * `gradle help` on task with no commandline properties
    * `gradle help` on task with commandline properties
    * `gradle help` on implicit task no commandline properties
    * `gradle help` on implicit task with no commandline properties
    * `gradle help --tassk help` (should print hint to `gradle help --task help`)

### Implementation approach

- Change configuration error message in `CommandLineTaskConfigurer` to suggest that the user run `gradle help --task <broken-task>`.
- Update the 'using Gradle from the command-line' user guide chapter.

## Help task shows legal values for each command-line option

### User visible changes

The usage message of running `gradle help --task init` includes the available values for the task command line options (e.g --type)

### Test coverage

* integration tests
    * `gradle help` on task with enum property type mapped to commandline option
    * `gradle help` on task with boolean property type mapped to commandline option
    * `gradle help` on task with String property mapped to commandline option
    * `gradle help --task init` shows all available init types

- A reasonable error message is provided when user specified an illegal value for an enum property from the command-line.
- A reasonable error message is provided when user specified an illegal value for an string property from the command-line.

### Implementation approach

- Introduce marker annotation `Option("optionName")` to mark a task property mapped to a commandline option.
- `@Option` with not provided "optionName" is mapped to option with same name as the annotated field
- `@Option("optionName")` annotated on Enums includes enum values as possible option values
- `@Option("optionName")` annotated on boolean includes true/false as possible option values
- `@Option("optionName")` annotated on a setter method evaluates the available options from the parameter type)
- Introduce marker annotation `OptionValues("optionName")` to to allow a dynamic value lookup in the task implementation itself.
- Adapt InitBuild task to use `@OptionValues` to map values for the `--type` command line option.
- Update the 'using Gradle from the command-line' user guide chapter.

## Add task validator for task options

### User visible changes

When task options that have unsupported option values, will throw an Exception pointing to the wrong assigned option value and hints
what values are supported.

### Implementation approach
- Add a task validator that validates a string property has a legal value at execution time.

## Support camel-case matching for task commandline property values

### Test coverage
- A reasonable error message is provided when a string property is configured with an illegal value in the build script.

### User visible changes

The user can run `gradle init --type java-lib` instead of `gradle init --type java-library`

### Test coverage

- Use camel-case matching for a commandline property that accepts an enum type
- Use camel-case matching for a commandline property that accepts an string type
- Error message for illegal enum value includes candidate matches
- Error message for illegal string value includes candidate matches

### Implementation approach

- Use NameMatcher in commandline configuration.

## Add --include @Option to the test task

### Test coverage:

    - check existing coverage of test.single for inspiration
    - for --include
        - happy path
        - include from command line takes precedence over the one declared in the build script
        (the include provided via commandline completely replaces existing includes)
        - is correctly incremental (e.g. same VS different values passed with --include)
        - "Could not find matching test" error is emitted when no tests found for given --include
        - 2 different test tasks, both use the option with different tests included

## Add --exclude @Option to the test task:

### Test coverage:

    - for --exclude
        - happy path
        - exclude from command line replaces any excludes declared in the build script
        (this behavior is consistent with --include)
        - is correctly incremental (e.g. same VS different values passed with the option)
        - "Could not find any tests" error is emitted when no tests found for given --exclude
        (consistently with --include)
    - for --include and --exclude both working together together
        - include declares a dir, exclude declares a single test from this dir
        - the behavior should be consistent to how it works currently via DSL API (given both: includes and excludes configured in the build script)

## Add --debug @Option to the test task

### Test coverage:

    - smoke test, make sure the task is happy with the option and that debug property is set on the task

## Add command-line options to more tasks

### User visible changes

- Add `@OptionValues` annotations for the options on `DependencyInsightReportTask`
- Add `@OptionValues` annotations for the options on `DependencyReportTask`
- Add `@OptionValues` annotations for the options on `Help`
- Probably more - see use cases above.

## Include the command-line options in the generated DSL reference

The reference page for a task type should show which command-line options are available for the type.

## Add an API to allow command-line options for a task to be declared programmatically

TBD

## Support additional property types

- Collection of any supported scalar type
- Conversion to `File`
- Conversion to `Number` or subclass

# Open issues

1. Figure out what to do if multiple tasks of different types are selected *and* there are clashing command line options.
For example, 'foo' option that requires a string value in one task type but is a boolean flag in some other task type.
This is not a blocker because we have very little command line options, yet.
1. Decide on precedence order if task is configured from the command line and in the build script. Add coverage, etc.
1. If a method marked with `@Option` accepts varargs or a Collection type as parameter, allow the command-line option to be specified multiple
   time on the command-line.
1. Output of `gradle help --task x` provides link to task documentation.
